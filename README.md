# project2

We had Ashok Goyal, Lamin Barrow, and Aaron Schneberger in a group. Lamin did the part of the notebook corresponding to the first two dataframes, category and subcategory. So he did the first cell up through cell 14. Ashok did the third dataframe (campaign), from cell 15 to cell 22. Aaron did the contacts dataframe, from cell 23 til cell 31. Aaron also did the two sql files.

The project_2_combined notebook is the main notebook, and it needs to be run to create the csvs needed for the SQL. 

The crowdfunding_db_schema.sql contains the schema data that is needed for the creation of the tables in the database. The query.sql file needs to be run afterwards, with each select statement being run separately, one after another.
